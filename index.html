				<h1>EXIGO</h1>
				<h2>Web Developer</h2>
				<p>At EXIGO, I worked with many different clients to give them the best site they could ask for. If it was entirely new pages for a product line, correcting exisiting functionality, or even creating new, custom features that the client requested, I tackled all requests sent my way. Some examples of my work for these clients can be seen at:</p>

				<h1>D.R. Horton</h1>
				<h2>UI Design Manager</h2>
				<p>
					I came in during the end of launch on <a href="http://www.drhorton.com" target="_blank">D.R. Horton's new website</a>. I was tasked with cleaning up individual pages, making sure that each page followed standards and guidelines. I was also responsible for teaching others how to add content or correct errors from their end. Additionally, I was entrusted with some graphic design work such as letterheads, envelopes, and even promotional billboards.

				<h1>Priscilla McCall's</h1>

					When Priscilla McCall's needed a flyer for their OMG! Class that would appear in stores, and <a href="http://www.priscillamccall.com/blog.cfm?entry=12-omg-class-with-tracie-quinn" target="_blank">online</a>, they sought me out. My flyer delivered and helped fill up the class. It was so successful that they will be hosting another class soon.

				<h1>Dealer Imaging</h1>
				<h2>Photo Editor</h2>
				<p>
					I received a list every day from different car dealerships nationwide who needed photos of their inventory edited to fit a more uniform look on their site. From home, I accessed many different dealerships' servers for the downloading, editing, and uploading of dozens of pictures on a daily basis.

				<h1>B. C. Cornish</h1>
				<h2>Web Designer</h2>
				<p>
					I designed, coded, and deployed <a href="http://www.ladylaw101.com" target="_blank">ladylaw101.com</a> for Ms. Cornish from the ground up. Though the site is intended for little traffic and an older audience, steps were taken to ensure minimal load times and even a little bit of responsive design was implemented.
